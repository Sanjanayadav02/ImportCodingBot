# ImportCodingBot
Multi purpose modular bot for Telegram written in Python

A live running version of the bot can be found [@ICFTGBot](http://t.me/ICFTGBot)  
It uses the MASTER_PREFIX "/" for all the commands.

## Contribution Guidelines
- You simply need to copy the `Plugin Template.py` file, paste it in the `ICBot/addons/` directory and make your changes in that file. 
- Make sure to read the template file carefully and keep in mind the conventions mentioned in there while making your changes, finally rename the file following the naming convention.
- Make a PR and wait for it to get approved!

Python and Pyrogram are the only pre-requisites, try contributing some interesting and original plugins :)

Happy coding!
